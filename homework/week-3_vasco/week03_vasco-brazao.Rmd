```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(rethinking)
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(22012022)

data(foxes)

d <- foxes
```

## 1

```{r one.data}
d1 <- d %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    A = rethinking::standardize(area),
    F = rethinking::standardize(avgfood)
  )
```

Since there is no back-door at all, we can simply regress Food on Area to get the total (and, in this case, also direct) causal effect of A on F.
