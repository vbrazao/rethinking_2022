```r
samples <- sample(
  x = grid,
  size = 1e4,
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = posterior
)

rethinking::PI(samples, prob = .89)
```

```
##        5%       94% 
## 0.5235235 0.8768769
```

```r
rethinking::HPDI(samples, prob = .89)
```

```
##     |0.89     0.89| 
## 0.5005005 0.8378378
```
 
The HPDI is slightly narrower. This is to be expected, since `PI()` chooses the *central* interval with 89% probability, while `HPDI()` finds the *narrowest* interval that contains 89% of the posterior probability.

From the intervals alone, I would likely assume the posterior to be almost symmetrical around them, and would completely miss that no probability at all is assigned to values between 0 and .5.

# generate biased binomial sample

                         # the true proportion of water
                         prob_water = .7,
                         # the proportion of true waters that are flipped to land
                         prob_flip = .2) {
  samples <- tibble(
    real = sample(
      x = c("W", "L"),
      size = nsamples,
      replace = TRUE,
      prob = c(prob_water, 1 - prob_water)
    ),
    biased = case_when(
      real == "W" ~ sample(
        x = c("W", "L"),
        size = nsamples,
        replace = TRUE,
        prob = c(1 - prob_flip, prob_flip)
      ),
      real == "L" ~ "L"
    )
  )

  return(samples)
}

# get the proportion of waters in a biased sample

biasedpropwater <- function() {
  prop <- biasedrbinom() %>%
    summarise(
      propW = sum(biased == "W") / length(biased)
    ) %>%
    pull(propW)

  return(prop)
}
```


```r
biasedproportions <- replicate(n = 1e4, expr = biasedpropwater())

hist(biasedproportions)
```

![](week01_vasco-brazao_files/figure-html/prob.four.calc-1.png)<!-- -->

The histogram shows that the biased generating process tends to produce proportions of water close to 56%, departing for the true value of 70%. 

Even though I can simulate this I'm not sure how to turn this into a likelihood yet, so not sure how to "analyze" this biased data... I guess it's like a zero-inflated beta model?
